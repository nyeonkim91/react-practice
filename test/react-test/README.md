# About

Try unit test of a project generated by CRA which already contains Jest.

# How to Run

`yarn test`

# The Gist

Try jest which is already set up in CRA. There are three primary keywords for test - `describe`, `it`, `expect`. There are more methods in Jest so check docs[https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect.html].

To compare a test to pre-test, called snapshot testing, install `react-test-renderer`.

Lastly, Using enzyme, test in detail like DOM event simulation and checking Life Cycle API. Before using this utility, need to create setupTests.js required for CRA. While enzyme helps test in detail, the result is difficult to recognize. So, apply `enzyme-to-json` to `jest` property in `package.json`.
